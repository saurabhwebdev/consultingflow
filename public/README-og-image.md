# OpenGraph Image Generation

This folder contains an HTML template (`og-image.html`) that can be used to generate the OpenGraph image for social media sharing.

## How to generate the image

1. Open the `og-image.html` file in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot of the entire page (make sure the dimensions are 1200x630)
3. Save the screenshot as `og-image.png` in this directory
4. Alternatively, use a headless browser or screenshot tool to automate this process

## Technical details

- The OpenGraph image has dimensions of 1200x630 pixels (standard OG image size)
- It features the Thoucentric logo on a dark gradient background
- The image is referenced in the main index.html file for social media sharing

## Troubleshooting

If the image doesn't appear properly when sharing:
- Make sure the path to the image is correct in index.html
- Verify that the image has been properly generated and saved
- Test with a social media preview tool like [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) or [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
